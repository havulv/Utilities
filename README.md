# Utilities

This is a header file for some small functions that I found helpful when debugging arrays and byte arrays. It is also useful for inspecting memory overlaps and out of bounds errors.

I made this primarily because I didn't need something huge like valgrind, but I still needed something to look at data within different structures.

## Testing

The tests I originally used are in the tests directory, but feel free to write your own tests or not. I am not your dad.

## Using

It's a header file. If you found this then I would assume that you know what `#include "utils.h"` does and how to link to the file when compiling. If not, feel free to reach out or google the answer.
